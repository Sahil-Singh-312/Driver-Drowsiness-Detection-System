# Driver Drowsiness Detection System

The Driver Drowsiness Detection System is a safety technology designed to monitor and analyze a driver's level of alertness in real-time, aiming to reduce accidents caused by driver fatigue. It uses sensors and cameras to continuously observe the driverâ€™s face, eye movements, and head position, analyzing patterns such as blinking rate, yawning frequency, and eye closure duration to assess drowsiness levels. If drowsiness is detected, the system provides immediate alerts through visual, auditory, or haptic feedback. This technology is beneficial for individual drivers, especially long-haul truck drivers and night shift workers, as well as fleet operators who manage commercial vehicles. Automotive manufacturers can integrate this system into new vehicle designs to enhance safety features, and it is also advantageous for public transportation to ensure the safety of passengers.
